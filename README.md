This is a Selenium Webdriver script to automate Wordpress testing.
It is tentatively called Scribe.

Before running, make sure the General Settings in settings.cfg are what you want them to be.
Namely, the Wordpress Login url and the browser e.g. Chrome.

Firefox requires the geckodriver. Google Chrome requires the ChromeDriver.

Next, simply run python scribe.py

Once you select an option, view the browser in which the script is running and move your cursor off the screen.
This prevents unwanted hover actions.
